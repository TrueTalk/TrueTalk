Set temperature to 60.
When temperature is 60 close all windows [extend: where|which]. // makes sense. recognize build-time optimization for first time exec.
When temperature is 60 open all windows [extend: where|which].  // contracdition. recognize build-time optimization for first time exec.
When temperature is 70 open all windows.                        // makes sense.
When temperature is 70 open all closed windows.                 // closed is redundant
When temperature is 70 open all opened windows.                 // action is redundant

ontology:   temperature ==> variable, quantity
            closed ==> opposite (open[ed])
            window ==> open/close
